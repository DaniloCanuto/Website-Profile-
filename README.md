Welcome to my website profile repo! In this end of module 1 assignment I utilized all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, plus everything else I've leaerned throughout my learning journey, to create a website worth of all the hard work I put in it. I hope you enjoy my first website project! I'm extremely proud of it!
